## **So you want to know a little about me?**

- - -

Well I started my journey learning some new web developer technology a little over a year ago. Recently I decided that I wanted a place to show what I have learned and share it with others. Currently I am working for Frito-Lay as a Robot Operator, I've been with them for 11 years. My end goal is to be able to do Full-Stack work. Hopefully you enjoy my posts and come back for more.
